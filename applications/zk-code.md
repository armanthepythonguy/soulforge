## [Section 1] Project Information

- **Project Name:** zk-code
- **Payment Details:** 0xE368E321f3DaB11486c71622D803FB89904790B9
- **Total Amount Requested:** 9,000 USDC

## [Section 2] Project Overview

- **Brief Description:**
zk-code is a platform that enables zero-knowledge verification of contributions to private repositories. It allows users to prove their contributions using their public key without revealing their identity, while repository owners can verify contributors without exposing the repository details.

- **Core Idea:**
The core idea is to create a system where developers can demonstrate their work on private projects without compromising privacy. This platform will use zero-knowledge proofs to verify Git commits and contributions, enabling a new level of privacy in open-source collaboration.

- **Technology Stack:**
Plonky3, Circom, Rust, React

- **Design Mockups/Prototypes (Optional):**

## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

- **Similar Projects:**
While there are projects focusing on general zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain, our project specifically targets the intersection of ZKPs and Git contributions, filling a unique niche in the developer ecosystem.

- **Unique Contribution:**
zk-code will provide a novel solution for verifying contributions to private repositories without compromising privacy, potentially revolutionizing how developers showcase their work on confidential projects.

## [Section 5] Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1 — Core ZKP Implementation

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Description:**
  1. Develop the core zero-knowledge proof system using Plonky3 and Circom.
  2. Implement basic Git commit verification circuits.
  3. Create a Rust backend to handle ZKP generation and verification.

- **FTE (Full-Time Equivalent):** 2 FTE
- **Costs:** 3000 USDC (4 Contributors * 750 USDC = 3000 USDC)

### Milestone 2 — Frontend and Integration

- **Estimated Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Description:** 
  1. Develop a React frontend for user interaction.
  2. Integrate the ZKP system with Git workflows.
  3. Implement privacy-preserving contribution aggregation.
  4. Implement a simple airdrop platform without revealing user's identity.

- **FTE:** 2 FTE
- **Costs:** 3000 USDC (4 Contributors * 750 USDC = 3000 USDC)

### Total Costs: 3000 + 3000 = 6000 USDC

## [Section 6] Extended Scope

- **Future Plans:**
  1. Expand support for different version control systems beyond Git.
  2. Implement advanced features such as reputation systems and anonymous code reviews.
  3. Explore integration with existing developer platforms and CI/CD pipelines.
