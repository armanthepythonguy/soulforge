## [Section 1] Project Information

  

-  **Project Name:** zklings

-  **Payment Details:** 0x5422d180660AD313eb916ca22dFD7BE02784c766

-  **Total Amount Requested:** 9,000 USDC

  

## [Section 2] Project Overview



-  **Brief Description:**

zklings contains small exercises to get new developers familiar with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) concepts, modular arithmetic and group theory and circuit implementation. This includes working with Plonky3 as a library and understanding the underlying mathematics! Right now we support Rust (Halo2) and Circom.
  

-  **Core Idea:**

The core idea is to have a contributor-driven open source repository that keeps up with the latest developments in the field of ZKP, and equips developers with the intuition of security assumptions and trade-offs that are being made when certain proving systems, commitment schemes, etc are used.

-  **Technology Stack:**

Plonky3, Circom, Rust, Halo2

-  **Design Mockups/Prototypes (Optional):**

Here is the repo that we are using as a foundation to build upon and extend: https://github.com/rutefig/zklings 

It was forked from https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings and follows the same flow.

## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

-  **Similar Projects:**

Each zkVM/zkEVM has its own set of documentation to introduce developers to their ecosystem and use their libraries to build applications. zklings is supposed to inform developers before diving into a specific ecosystem by learning about foundational concepts and using Plonky3 as a toolkit to experiment.
  

-  **Unique Contribution:**

zklings will be the entry point for developers to learn about ZKP concepts and get hands-on experience developing with Circom and Plonky3.

## [Section 5] Development Roadmap
  

### Milestone 1 — Basic Functionality

  

-  **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks

-  **Description:**
   - 1. Team alignment and contributor onboarding.
   - 2. Alignment on the scope of exercises to be completed.
   - 3. Start building exercise prototypes.

-  **FTE (Full-Time Equivalent):** 3 FTE

-  **Costs:** 4,500 USDC (6 Contributors * 750 USDC = 4,500 USDC)

  

### Milestone 2 — Additional Features

  

-  **Estimated Duration:** 3 weeks

-  **Description:** 
   - 1. Finish building exercise prototypes (including tests and solutions, hints, and other resources).
   - 2. Onboard new contributors.
   - 3. Test zklings with zk learners.

-  **FTE:** 3 FTE

-  **Costs:** 4,500 USDC (6 Contributors * 750 USDC = 4,500 USDC)

  
  ### Total Costs: 4500 + 4500 = 9000 USDC

## [Section 6] Extended Scope

  

-  **Future Plans:**

zklings will be maintained by its contributors and aims to get continuously extended with new exercises.
